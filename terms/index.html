General</h4><p>These Terms & Conditions contain the entire agreement between CRAAPS and the individual(s) intending to charter the boat (“Charterer”), (collectively “the parties”), for a bareboat charter from CRAAPS with respect to the rights and responsibilities of all parties. Notwithstanding that, the parties, the boat, the period and the price are stipulated in the invoice provided separately. By accepting the rental, Charterer agrees to the conditions contained below.</p><h4 id=2-payment-schedule>2. Payment schedule</h4><p>Unless other arrangements have been confirmed separately the following schedule applies</p><p><strong>a.</strong> Initial Deposit: 30% of the charter fee, which confirms booking;<br><strong>b.</strong> Remaining 70% of the charter fee and payment for any add-on options due 45 days before embarkation.<br></p><h4 id=3-boat-delivery>3. Boat Delivery</h4><p>CRAAPS will deliver the boat to the Charterer only under the following conditions:</p><p><strong>a.</strong> Full payment of any balance or security deposit due from Charterer,<br><strong>b.</strong> Receipt of the following documents from Charterer:</p><ul><li>Copy of Charterer’s driver’s license or identification card;</li><li>Copy of Charterer’s passport; and</li><li>Listing of charter’s crew members with names and addresses</li></ul><p><strong>c.</strong> In the event CRAAPS believes that Charterer’s and crew’s sailing experience is deficient, CRAAPS reserves the right to cancel or modify the charter and will not refund Charterer for
payments made to date. If available, CRAAPS may offer to provide an approved skipper at Charterer’s expenses. If an approved skipper is provided, Charterer may not discharge the skipper before completion of the charter, except with CRAAP’s consent. If no skipper available, Charterer will be allowed to use the Boat staying moored to the dock.</p><p><strong>d.</strong> Occasionally operational reasons may result in your booked boat being substituted and CRAAPS reserves the right to provide an alternative boat. If your boat changes after booking, you will be notified as soon as is reasonably possible. You will be offered a boat of equal or greater size/specifications and not additionally charged the difference if upgraded to a more expensive category. If the only alternative available is cheaper, you are entitled to a refund of the price difference.</p><p><strong>e.</strong> Delivery of the boat will be at Kaløvig Bådehavn (15 km North of Aaarhus) moored at dock or on trailer in Aarhus Havn or (if specifically agreed) moored at dock in Aarhus Havn.</p><p><strong>f.</strong> The boat is delivered with a full tank of 95 octane unleaded fuel.</p><h4 id=4-boat-re-delivery>4. Boat Re-Delivery</h4><p><strong>a.</strong> The Boat shall be returned to End Port i.e. to the exact same spot as delivered (unless other arrangements have been agreed in writing) on the date and time as specified in Charterer’s invoice.</p><p><strong>b.</strong> If re-delivery of the Boat is delayed by reason of force majeure as defined below, re-delivery shall be affected as soon as possible thereafter and the meantime the conditions of the Agreement shall remain in force but without penalty or additional charge against the Charterer.</p><p><strong>c.</strong> In case of delay on return, Charterer agrees to pay CRAAPS the prorated charter fee plus 50%. Any begun day beyond the charter term is considered a full day. If Charterer abandons the Boat anywhere other than the specified End Port, he agrees to pay CRAAPS all costs and fees incurred to return the Boat to the specified End Port, as well as a prorated charter fee compensation for the number of days necessary to sail the boat back to the base. Abandonment is defined as leaving the Boat for longer than a 12-hour period.</p><p><strong>d.</strong> If the Charterer fails to re-deliver the Boat to the Owner at the End Port of the Re-Delivery due to intentional delay or change of itinerary, Charterer agrees to pay DYC the prorated charter fee plus 50%. Any begun day beyond the charter term is considered as a full day. If delay in re-delivery exceeds twenty-four (24) hours, the Charterer shall be liable to indemnify the Owner for any loss or damage which the Owner shall suffer by reason of deprivation of use of the Boat or cancellation of, or delay in delivery under, any subsequent charter of the Boat.</p><p><strong>e.</strong> The boat is returned with a full tank of 95 octane unleaded fuel.</p><h4 id=5-warranties-and-procedures-of-craaps>5. Warranties and Procedures of CRAAPS</h4><p><strong>a.</strong> CRAAPS represents, warrants, and covenants that, at Delivery, the Boat will comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the Boat’s flag state and any country within the Cruising Area (i.e. Denmark unless other area specifically agreed), including, without limitation, any laws and regulations governing charters and any documentation, registration, or customs laws or regulations, such that the Boat may lawfully be used by the Charterer as provided hereunder. CRAAPS agrees to deliver to Charterer a boat in good working order.</p><p><strong>b.</strong> Check-in procedures begin at charter start time. Upon check-in, charterer can freely use the Boat as soon as he has signed the delivery statement and received all the boat documents.</p><p><strong>c.</strong> The Charterer is responsible for his own arrangements and costs of mooring, except in case of mooring in the CRAAPS home spot in Kaløvig Bådehavn. The home spot can be used free of charge.</p><p><strong>d.</strong> CRAAPS will commit to answer to any reclamation received no later than 1 month after the return of the Charterer.</p><h4 id=6-representations-and-warranties-of-charterer>6. Representations and Warranties of Charterer</h4><p><strong>a.</strong> If the Charterer (or a member of the crew) is to operate the Boat, the Charterer represents and warrants that the Charterer is experienced, licensed, if applicable, and competent in the handling and operation of a Boat of the type named in this Agreement and that the Charterer has sufficient practical knowledge of seamanship, piloting, and Rules-of-the-Road to properly exercise full authority over the Boat. The Charterer shall allow the Boat to be operated during the Charter Period only by a person qualified to do so.</p><h4 id=7-responsibilities-of-charterer>7. Responsibilities of Charterer</h4><p><strong>a.</strong> At check-in, Charterer will check that boat and equipment is in good working order and up to minimum standards. Charterer will note if anything is missing compared to the specification: <a href=https://craaps.dk/boat/>https://craaps.dk/boat/</a></p><p>At this time, Charterer can note with CRAAPS anything it believes contrary or below the standards as set forth in the invoice. Acceptance of the boat certifies that the obligations of CRAAPS for delivery have been fulfilled.</p><p><strong>b.</strong> Upon delivery, Charterer and crew are fully responsible for the Boat and for any damage to property or injury to persons that could happen including third parties. In the event a skipper has been provided by CRAAPS, Charterer will remain responsible for the boat and the behavior and well-being of crew.</p><p><strong>c.</strong> Charterer agrees to be responsible for all crew and passengers on board and binds crew and passengers to the terms provided herein.</p><p><strong>d.</strong> Charterer will be responsible for all boat damages during the charter and will pay for these plus operating expenses incurred after delivery of the boat, such as mooring fees and fuel.</p><p><strong>e.</strong> If outside assistance is needed due to problems with the boat, Charterer will promptly notify CRAAPS before incurring any such expense unless delay would risk personal injury or significant property damage. Charterer will keep all invoices and receipts concerning repairs that CRAAPS will reimburse on return day, or as soon as possible. Charterer will take all reasonable steps to prevent the towing of the boat by another Boat. However, if towing is necessary despite all reasonable efforts, Charterer agrees to negotiate and fix the price of towing with the other Boat’s captain before operating. Charterer cannot commit to any commitments or costs on behalf of CRAAPS or involving the boat (see also 11.b).</p><p><strong>f.</strong> In case of an accident involving another Boat, the Charterer must contact CRAAPS immediately and follow CRAAPS instructions, independently of the Charterer having damaged the CRAAPS Boat and/or the other Boat. Charterer agrees to carry only up to the number of passengers required by security rules of the boat.</p><p><strong>g.</strong> Charterer agrees that he/she will not transport merchandise or carry passengers for pay or have any other commercial activity such as professional fishing. Sub-lending or -renting of the boat is prohibited.</p><p><strong>h.</strong> Charterer agrees to use the boat as a responsible person and will comply with all laws, including but not limited to, fishing and deep sea fishing regulations. Charterer will hold CRAAPS harmless from and against any and all claims and legal actions arising under or in connection with this Contract for failure to abide by those rules and regulations.</p><p><strong>i.</strong> The boat must be returned with all gear aboard in the same good conditions as upon departure, in good cleaning conditions, on the specified End Date, time, and End Port.</p><p><strong>j.</strong> Charterer agrees to pay for any loss or damage not covered by Insurance that can occur on or to the Boat until return. Charterer remains fully responsible for the Boat until signature of the return counter-inventory and final disembarkation.</p><p><strong>k.</strong> Charterer agrees to stay within the approved cruising ground as provided by CRAAPS and/or by law. Charterer agrees not to leave the harbor or mooring with winds over force 6 (strong wind / storm) or if this strength of wind is forecasted, if port authorities have prohibited any navigation, if the Boat is damaged and not repaired, and if any vital equipment such as engine, GPS, gears, security equipment are not in good working conditions, if fuel reserves are not sufficient, if, in general, weather, Boat or crew conditions endanger Boat or crew. Charterer agrees to follow any navigation and routing instructions which CRAAPS may give him especially in the event of bad weather.</p><p><strong>l.</strong> Any likeness or image of you or your party aboard your chartered Boat secured during your charter may be used by CRAAPS without charge in all media for bona fide promotional or marketing purposes, including without limitation promotional materials of any kind, such as brochures, slides, video shows, advertisements and the internet.</p><h4 id=8-damage-depositinsurance-deductible>8. Damage Deposit/Insurance Deductible</h4><p>The operator has taken out insurance cover for the chartered boat and the charter client, against all accidental damage including damage to third parties.
However, the theft or loss of personal belongings of the charter client as well as of all the people on board, likewise all accidents of which they may be victims, are excluded from the scope of this insurance.
In the event of any damage whatsoever, including to third parties or theft, the charter client must submit a sea report, including, if necessary, a response statement to that of the third party with the full contact details of third parties and their own insurers, and in all cases notify the operator immediately. Failure to do so is covered in the provisions of Article 13 “Voluntary Breach”.
The insurance cover taken out by the Operator includes an excess deposit which will be borne by the charter client. The latter therefore remains his own insurer for any loss or damage whatsoever, including those caused to others, not covered by the insurance, up to the amount of the deposit specified in the special contractual conditions.
The charter client can ask CRAAPS for a reduction of this deposit by means of additional optional contractual fees – this extra is mandatory for a charter with skipper and in some destinations, indicated in the booking confirmation.</p><p>In all cases, a minimum security deposit as defined by the specific contractual conditions will remain the responsibility of the charter client. The operator will not be required to provide the charter client with a replacement boat or to pay any compensation in the event of immobilization of the chartered boat following accidental damage during the charter.</p><h4 id=9-contract-cancellation-and-changes>9. Contract Cancellation and changes</h4><p><strong>a.</strong> If Charterer cancels more than 14 days before original charter start, CRAAPS provides a full refund.<br><strong>b.</strong> If Charterer cancels less than 14 days before charter start, Charterer will lose the charter fee paid to date.<br><strong>c.</strong> Changes to dates and or yachts booked are subject to current prices.</p><h4 id=10-force-majeure>10. Force Majeure</h4><p><strong>a.</strong> CRAAPS shall not be liable for any loss, damages or delay or failure in performance hereunder resulting from any force majeure event, including but not limited to acts of God, fire, action of the elements, epidemics, war (declared or undeclared), warlike actions, insurrection, revolution or civil strife, piracy, civil war or hostile action, strikes or differences with workmen, acts of the public enemy, federal or state laws, rules and regulations of any governmental authorities having or asserting jurisdiction in the premises or of any other group, organization or informal association (whether or not formally recognized as a government), and any other cause beyond the reasonable control of CRAAPS which makes continuance of operations impossible.</p><h4 id=11-miscellaneous>11. Miscellaneous</h4><p><strong>a.</strong> Governing Laws: Any legal action arising under or in connection with this contract will be adjudicated in Denmark under Danish Law.</p><p><strong>b.</strong> Maritime Liens: The Charterer shall not incur or allow any maritime lien, salvage, or debt on the Boat or on CRAAPS’s credit. The Charterer shall not abandon the Boat or enter into any salvage agreement without the CRAAPS’s prior written consent. The Charterer shall indemnify and hold CRAAPS harmless against and from any liability for any maritime lien, salvage, or debt that arises on the Boat or CRAAPS’s credit as a result of any act or omission of the Charterer.</p></div></article></div></div></div></section><section id=footer class=fragment><div class="container-fluid bg-secondary"><div class="container py-5"><div class=row><div class="col-md m-2 text-body"><h4></h4><a href=#><img src=/images/logo.png class="img-fluid w-50" alt></a><div class="row justify-content-left ml-0"><span class="fa-stack fa-2x mt-3 mr-1" title=linkedin><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/craaps/ class=ignore-color-change><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fab fa-linkedin-in fa-stack-1x fa-fw text-light"></i><span class=sr-only>linkedin</span></a></span></div></div><div class="col-md m-2 text-body"><h4>NAVIGATION</h4><ul class="nav flex-column"><li class=nav-item><a class="nav-link p-0 display-5" href=/boat>The Boat</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class="nav-link p-0 display-5" href=/prices>Prices</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class="nav-link p-0 display-5" href=/terms>Terms</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-md m-2 text-body"><div><h4 id=coach-rib-aarhus>COACH RIB AARHUS</h4><hr><p>Bondehaven 14<br>8541 Skødstrup, Denmark<br>T: +45 2154 8230
