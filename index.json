CRAAPS rates are negotiated and agreed on individual basis depending on season and depending of duration of the charter. We wish to offer chartering rates that are competitive to any alternative that you may have. Please fill in the contact form, specifying who you are, which event you are attending in Aarhus / the purpose of your charter, the dates / times suggested and we will contact you with an offer. Trusted friends and returning customers from the active Aarhus-area sailing community are offered discounted rates, of course, so please keep coming back to us.\n","permalink":"https://craaps.dk/prices/","tags":null,"title":"Prices"},{"categories":null,"contents":"1. General These Terms \u0026 Conditions contain the agreement between CRAAPS and the individual(s) intending to charter the service (“Charterer”), (collectively “the parties”), for a charter from CRAAPS with respect to the rights and responsibilities of all parties. Notwithstanding that, the parties, the service, the period and the price are stipulated in the invoice provided separately. By accepting the rental, Charterer agrees to the conditions contained below.\n2. Payment schedule Unless other arrangements have been confirmed separately the following schedule applies\na. Initial Deposit: 30% of the charter fee, which confirms booking;\nb. Remaining 70% of the charter fee and payment for any add-on options before embarkation.\n3. Boat Delivery CRAAPS will deliver the service to the Charterer only under the following conditions:\na. Full payment of any balance or security deposit due from Charterer,\nb. Receipt of the following documents from Charterer:\n Copy of Charterer’s driver’s license or identification card;  c. CRAAPS will provide an approved skipper. Charterer may not discharge the skipper before completion of the charter. If no skipper available, Charterer will be allowed to use the Boat staying moored to the dock.\nd. Occasionally operational reasons may result in your booked boat being substituted and CRAAPS reserves the right to provide an alternative boat. If your boat changes after booking, you will be notified as soon as is reasonably possible. You will be offered a service of equal or greater size/specifications and not additionally charged the difference if upgraded to a more expensive category. If the only alternative available is cheaper, you are entitled to a refund of the price difference.\ne. Delivery of the service will be at Kaløvig Bådehavn (15 km North of Aaarhus) moored at dock or on trailer in Aarhus Havn or (if specifically agreed) moored at dock in Aarhus Havn.\n4. Warranties and Procedures of CRAAPS a. CRAAPS represents, warrants, and covenants that, at Delivery, the Boat will comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the Boat’s flag state and any country within the Cruising Area (i.e. Denmark unless other area specifically agreed), including, without limitation, any laws and regulations governing charters and any documentation, registration, or customs laws or regulations.\nb. CRAAPS will commit to answer to any reclamation received no later than 1 month after the return of the Charterer.\nThe operator has taken out insurance cover for the chartered boat and the charter client, against all accidental damage including damage to third parties. However, the theft or loss of personal belongings of the charter client as well as of all the people on board, likewise all accidents of which they may be victims, are excluded from the scope of this insurance. In the event of any damage whatsoever, including to third parties or theft, the charter client must submit a sea report, including, if necessary, a response statement to that of the third party with the full contact details of third parties and their own insurers, and in all cases notify the operator immediately. Failure to do so is covered in the provisions of Article 13 “Voluntary Breach”. The insurance cover taken out by the Operator includes an excess deposit which will be borne by the charter client. The latter therefore remains his own insurer for any loss or damage whatsoever, including those caused to others, not covered by the insurance, up to the amount of the deposit specified in the special contractual conditions. The charter client can ask CRAAPS for a reduction of this deposit by means of additional optional contractual fees – this extra is mandatory for a charter with skipper and in some destinations, indicated in the booking confirmation.\nIn all cases, a minimum security deposit as defined by the specific contractual conditions will remain the responsibility of the charter client. The operator will not be required to provide the charter client with a replacement boat or to pay any compensation in the event of immobilization of the chartered boat following accidental damage during the charter.\n-- 5. Contract Cancellation and changes a. If Charterer cancels more than 14 days before original charter start, CRAAPS provides a full refund.\nb. If Charterer cancels less than 14 days before charter start, Charterer will lose the charter fee paid to date.\nc. Changes to dates and or yachts booked are subject to current prices.\n6. Force Majeure a. CRAAPS shall not be liable for any loss, damages or delay or failure in performance hereunder resulting from any force majeure event, including but not limited to acts of God, fire, action of the elements, epidemics, war (declared or undeclared), warlike actions, insurrection, revolution or civil strife, piracy, civil war or hostile action, strikes or differences with workmen, acts of the public enemy, federal or state laws, rules and regulations of any governmental authorities having or asserting jurisdiction in the premises or of any other group, organization or informal association (whether or not formally recognized as a government), and any other cause beyond the reasonable control of CRAAPS which makes continuance of operations impossible.\n7. Miscellaneous a. Governing Laws: Any legal action arising under or in connection with this contract will be adjudicated in Denmark under Danish Law.\nb. Maritime Liens: The Charterer shall not incur or allow any maritime lien, salvage, or debt on the Boat or on CRAAPS’s credit. The Charterer shall not abandon the Boat or enter into any salvage agreement without the CRAAPS’s prior written consent. The Charterer shall indemnify and hold CRAAPS harmless against and from any liability for any maritime lien, salvage, or debt that arises on the Boat or CRAAPS’s credit as a result of any act or omission of the Charterer.\n","permalink":"https://craaps.dk/terms/","tags":null,"title":"Rental Terms"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Coach Rib Aarhus \u0026lt;3 CRAAPS\n Based in the beautiful bay of Aarhus - CRAApS gives a unique opportunity to explore the bay, Aarhus harbour and nearby islands.\nFounded in 2021 by Mogens and Allan - Sailors, and heavily involved with the local dinghy club for young inspiring sailors - We wanted to give the opportunity for others to experience the speed, wind and amazing area.\n","permalink":"https://craaps.dk/about/","tags":null,"title":"About CRAApS"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"https://craaps.dk/","tags":null,"title":"Rent A RIB | Aarhus"}]
