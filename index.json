CRAAPS rates are negotiated and agreed on individual basis depending on season and depending of duration of the charter. We wish to offer chartering rates that are competitive to any alternative that you may have. Please fill in the contact form, specifying who you are, which event you are attending in Aarhus / the purpose of your charter, the dates / times suggested and we will contact you with an offer. Trusted friends and returning customers from the active Aarhus-area sailing community are offered discounted rates, of course, so please keep coming back to us.\n","permalink":"https://craaps.dk/prices/","tags":null,"title":"Prices"},{"categories":null,"contents":"1.

Damage Deposit/Insurance Deductible The operator has taken out insurance cover for the chartered boat and the charter client, against all accidental damage including damage to third parties. However, the theft or loss of personal belongings of the charter client as well as of all the people on board, likewise all accidents of which they may be victims, are excluded from the scope of this insurance. In the event of any damage whatsoever, including to third parties or theft, the charter client must submit a sea report, including, if necessary, a response statement to that of the third party with the full contact details of third parties and their own insurers, and in all cases notify the operator immediately. Failure to do so is covered in the provisions of Article 13 “Voluntary Breach”. The insurance cover taken out by the Operator includes an excess deposit which will be borne by the charter client. The latter therefore remains his own insurer for any loss or damage whatsoever, including those caused to others, not covered by the insurance, up to the amount of the deposit specified in the special contractual conditions. The charter client can ask CRAAPS for a reduction of this deposit by means of additional optional contractual fees – this extra is mandatory for a charter with skipper and in some destinations, indicated in the booking confirmation.\nIn all cases, a minimum security deposit as defined by the specific contractual conditions will remain the responsibility of the charter client. The operator will not be required to provide the charter client with a replacement boat or to pay any compensation in the event of immobilization of the chartered boat following accidental damage during the charter.\n9.

Miscellaneous a. Governing Laws: Any legal action arising under or in connection with this contract will be adjudicated in Denmark under Danish Law.\nb. Maritime Liens: The Charterer shall not incur or allow any maritime lien, salvage, or debt on the Boat or on CRAAPS’s credit. The Charterer shall not abandon the Boat or enter into any salvage agreement without the CRAAPS’s prior written consent. The Charterer shall indemnify and hold CRAAPS harmless against and from any liability for any maritime lien, salvage, or debt that arises on the Boat or CRAAPS’s credit as a result of any act or omission of the Charterer.\n","permalink":"https://craaps.dk/terms/","tags":null,"title":"Rental Terms"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We have a number of boats available for rental.
